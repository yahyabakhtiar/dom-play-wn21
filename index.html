    With a haughty wave, the Prince instructs his FOOTMAN to

              always
              The same old bread and rolls to sell

     returns it to the shelves of the town's "library": a COUPLE DOZEN BOOKS in total. She remains hopeful.
 </span></p>
   <p><span data-actor="Jean">jean:  I believe I have. Problem is, I can't
              remember what. Well, I'm sure it will

          He's such a tall, dark, strong and
          handsome brute
